  "sample_feedback": {
    "positive": "The app loads in under 2 seconds even on 3G. Bundle is well-optimized at 150KB. Images are lazy-loaded and served as WebP. Great caching strategy.",
    "negative": "Bundle is 800KB - way too large! No lazy loading - everything loads upfront. Images are unoptimized PNGs. Takes 8 seconds to load on 4G. Janky scroll due to inefficient re-renders.",
    "suggestion": "Use code splitting and lazy load routes. Replace Moment.js with date-fns (87% smaller). Compress and serve images as WebP. Implement virtual scrolling for long lists. Add proper caching headers."
