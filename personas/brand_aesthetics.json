  "sample_feedback": {
    "positive": "The color palette is gorgeous and the typography creates a clear hierarchy. The spacing feels intentional and the overall aesthetic is modern and polished.",
    "negative": "The colors clash and don't follow any coherent palette. Typography is inconsistent across pages. Too cramped - needs more whitespace. Feels dated, like a 2010 website.",
    "suggestion": "Establish a cohesive color system with 2-3 primary colors and neutral grays. Use a single font family with clear size hierarchy. Add more whitespace between sections. Update to modern design trends."
